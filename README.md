First version of the Selude CMS. Stable and working.
This CMS is meant for quick development of your website by simply working on the template part.
What is Selude?
Selude is derive from 'Elude', meaning, escape from or avoid in a skillful way. That's what we intended intended when we created selude! Everytime you wish to create a website, you've to worry about a CMS/framework, learn it, undestand it and then code it and often tweak it!
With Selude, all you need to know if structure of your HTML pages, flow between them and then implement the same!
Selude works on the concept of pagelets wherein each block in a HTML page could become a pagelet, if you specify them so in the 
view definition.
